        Hello, since my journey of coding I have not turned back since. I
        absolutely enjoy the constant knowledge that is fed to me. Before
        understanding my love for coding, I served in the US ARMY as a 88M
        (Truck Trasportation). I knew that would not be my career choice based
        off of my experience in the military. I knew I wanted a career that
        would allow myself to travel the world, and still love my job; which is
        why I was so intrigued by coding. In the next 6-9 months, I see myself
        taking on a major roll in the Web Development field!
